        <p>Lachlan began his official PNW journey in 2021 as a member of Sanctuary, where he first developed foundational skills in Internal Affairs (IA) and Foreign Affairs (FA). Eager to expand his knowledge, he later joined Aurora, continuing his contributions within IA.
His journey next led him to Cosmonauts, where he supported both Economic Affairs (EA) and IA, further broadening his experience across departments. After a brief two-week stint in Camelot, Lachlan found his footing in Gods of Orbis, stepping up as second-in-command and head of the FA department—a defining leadership role that allowed him to truly make his mark.
Seeking action, he moved to Hand of Fate/Knights Templar, diving back into raiding and participating in wars with them. Eventually, he found a long-term home in Arkham Asylum, working alongside Seb for over a year. During this time, he served as Military Affairs (MA) and became a key figure in FA, especially during periods when the government was understaffed.
By July, burnout began to take its toll. Lachlan stepped down from Arkham and joined Eclipse, planning to retire from the game a week later. But as fate would have it, his passion slowly returned. Two months later, he made his way back to Arkham Asylum, slowly but surely regaining energy.
Not long after, a new opportunity arose. NotSad approached him with the idea of building something fresh—something... heroic. On December 2nd, 2024, Lachlan became one of the founding members of Vought International, taking on one of two roles in the newly established FA department.</p>
